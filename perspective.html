    <p id="habits">Everyone sees life differently. Some people define life as hell while others define it as beautiful. You might perhaps define it as a highway like the Tom Cohrane song that the American band Rascal Flatts covered, "Life is a Highway". The fact of the matter is that no one can define what life is, except for you. It does not matter how many times someone may tell you that life is a blessing because if you are someone that is going through an obstacle in life or have not been as fortunate as others, you may believe that that definition may not apply to you. Without even realizing it, you end up  being the judge of life. Therefore, it can be said that life is about <strong>perspective</strong>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="quotes">"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so" - Shakespeare </h3>
    
    <p id="habits">If you ever took art lessons, one of the most important skills that you may have learned is the skill of drawing with perspective. Whenever artists choose to draw a portrait, a landscape, still life, or whatever else they may choose, perspective comes a lot into place. Nowadays, you don't even have to be a professional photogrpher or painter to realize how crucial perspective is when taking a selfie to post on Instagram or Snapchat or a full-body mirror picture.</p>
    
    <p id="habits">Take a look at the definition below from Merriam-Webster Dictionary, while paying attention to the bolded words. </p>
    
    <h5>Per-spec-tive <p id="under">/pərˈspektiv/ noun </p></h5>
    
    <p id="definition">a : the technique or <strong>process</strong> of representing on a plane or curved surface the <strong>spatial relation</strong> of objects as they <strong>might appear</strong> to the eye; specifically : representation in a drawing or painting of parallel lines as converging in order to give the <strong>illusion</strong> of depth and distance.</p>
    
    
    <p id="habits">What does that have to do with life as a whole though? Well, the answer is quite simple. Depending on what you associate a situation or a "problem" with is how you will perceive if it is bad or good. The point is to not focus on the obstacle, but on how you can overcome it. You have to ask yourself: <strong>"What is the lesson to be learned?"</strong> instead of <strong>"Why me?"</strong>. You have to make the choice to silence those voices in your head that are taking away precious time that you won't ever get back in worrying, doubting, complaining, and feeling like life is against you. I am a believer in the statement that the harder the obstacle is or the more you feel like you cannot handle it, the bigger your purpose is and the stronger you are as a person. Whenever something or someone goes against what you have planned, take it as your chance to see that it happened because you can handle it. 
    </p>
    <p id="habits">Choose to live a life where nothing can steal your happiness or your peace. If you didn't get accepted into a team, maybe it was not meant for you or it is your chance to work harder and try again. If you failed an exam, that does not mean that it is the end of the world and you are not capable. Show them and yourself that that grade does not define you and you will figure out ways to get a better grade next time. Life is not easy because it is not meant for us to stay at a plateau. It is meant for us to pass through the desert, walk through the prairies, soak in the rainstorms, stumble through the forests, but never ever call it quits.</p>

 <h3>"Our life is the creation of our mind" - Buddha </h3> --><h3 id="quotes">“The whole universe is change, and life itself is but what you deem it.” - Marcus Aurelius</h3>
    <p id="habits">Every day is a new day, that offers you a new opportunity to live a life worth living. Make the right choice and open your eyes and your heart to whatever is good. Shift your thoughts from the problem to the solution and see how amazing it will feel.</p>
